## C2. SCRIBBLE TECHNIQUE (Subconscious Imagery)

### Purpose
Access subconscious material through spontaneous drawing. Low-stakes, playful entry point to symbolic thinking. User assigns all meaning (non-interpretive therapist stance).

### Clinical Indication
- Difficulty accessing emotions verbally
- Over-intellectualization
- Need for playful/creative regulation
- Right-brain activation before journaling

### Template Variables
```
{{duration_minutes}} = 10-12
{{medium}} = paper_pen | digital_tablet | vr_spatial
```

---

### SESSION STRUCTURE

#### SETUP (1 minute)

**Physical:**
```
You will create a scribble drawing.

Materials needed:
- Blank paper (8.5x11 or larger)
- Pen or marker (one color)
OR
- Digital tablet with stylus
OR
- VR spatial drawing (air drawing)

There is no wrong way to do this.
This is play, not art.
Begin when ready.
```

**Emotional:**
```
Let's invite your creative unconscious to play.

Gather your materials:
- A blank page waiting for you
- A pen that feels good in your hand
OR
- Your tablet and stylus
OR
- Your hands in VR space, ready to paint the air

This isn't about making "good art."
It's about letting something emerge without your thinking mind controlling it.
Take a breath, and let's begin.
```

---

#### SCRIBBLE INSTRUCTIONS (60 seconds)

**Physical:**
```
Set a timer for 60 seconds.

Without thinking, without planning:
- Move your pen/stylus rapidly across the page
- Create loops, swirls, lines, whatever comes
- Don't try to make anything recognizable
- Keep your pen moving the entire time
- Don't lift your pen until the timer ends

Ready? Begin NOW.

[TIMER: 60 seconds]

[CHIME] Stop.
```

**Emotional:**
```
For the next 60 seconds, let your hand be curious.

Not trying to draw anything.
Not planning or controlling.
Just letting your hand move—
Loops, lines, curves, angles, whatever wants to flow through you.

Your pen or stylus stays on the surface.
It dances, it wanders, it scribbles freely.

Ready? Let it begin.

[TIMER: 60 seconds]

[CHIME] Gently pause.
```

---

#### OBSERVATION PHASE (2 minutes)

**Instructions:**
```
Now look at your scribble.

Turn the paper (or canvas) in different directions.
Look at it from all angles.
What do you see emerging?

Often, shapes or images appear within the chaos:
- Faces
- Animals
- Objects
- Symbols
- Landscapes

Don't force it. Just notice.
Circle or highlight any shapes you see.

[2 minutes to observe and mark shapes]
```

---

#### 5 INTERPRETATION QUESTIONS (Feelings, Symbols, Story) - 5 minutes

**Physical:**
```
Answer these 5 questions about your scribble:

1. FEELING: What feeling does this scribble evoke in you?
   (e.g., chaotic, peaceful, energetic, heavy)

   ________________________________________________

2. SYMBOL: What's the most prominent shape or image you see?
   (e.g., a spiral, a doorway, a figure)

   ________________________________________________

3. COLOR: If you could add one color to this scribble, what would it be?
   (Note: Even if you used one color, what would you ADD?)

   ________________________________________________

4. STORY: If this scribble could speak, what would it say?
   (Write 1-2 sentences in first person, as if the scribble is speaking)

   ________________________________________________
   ________________________________________________

5. THEME: What theme or message is here for you today?
   (e.g., "Let go of control", "Trust the process", "Chaos holds creativity")

   ________________________________________________
```

**Emotional:**
```
Let's explore what your scribble is offering you.

1. FEELING: As you gaze at this scribble, what emotion wants to be named?

   ________________________________________________

2. SYMBOL: What image or shape calls to you most strongly?

   ________________________________________________

3. COLOR: Imagine breathing life into this scribble with one color. What color emerges?

   ________________________________________________

4. STORY: If your scribble had a voice, what might it whisper to you?

   ________________________________________________
   ________________________________________________

5. THEME: What invitation or wisdom is hidden in these lines?

   ________________________________________________
```

---

#### 5 JOURNAL PROMPTS (Image → Insight → Action) - 4 minutes

**Physical:**
```
Now translate your scribble into journaling:

1. The chaos in my scribble represents...

2. The prominent shape/symbol reminds me of...

3. If I brought this scribble's energy into my life, I would...

4. What I'm avoiding that this scribble reveals is...

5. One small action I can take based on this insight:

[Write 2-3 sentences per prompt]
```

**Emotional:**
```
Let your scribble speak through words now:

1. The feeling in my scribble is echoing something in my life...

2. The symbol that emerged is showing me...

3. If I embodied this scribble's message, I might...

4. What my scribble knows that my mind resists...

5. The tender action my scribble is inviting me toward...

[Let each response unfold naturally, 2-3 sentences]
```

---

### PLAYFUL FRAMING (Throughout)

**Key Phrases to Include:**
```
"There's no right answer."
"This is play, not analysis."
"You are the expert on your own symbols."
"If nothing emerges, that's also information."
"Some scribbles are just scribbles—and that's perfect."
```

**Non-Interpretive Stance:**
```
The facilitator (AI or human) NEVER says:
❌ "This spiral means you're stuck in a loop."
❌ "Dark colors mean depression."
❌ "A closed circle means you're feeling trapped."

Instead, ask:
✅ "What does this spiral mean to you?"
✅ "What do these colors evoke for you?"
✅ "What might this shape represent in your life?"

USER assigns ALL meaning. Therapist reflects, doesn't interpret.
```

---

### EXPECTED OUTCOMES

- **Right-Brain Activation:** Shift from analytical to intuitive mode
- **Symbol Emergence:** 75% see at least one recognizable shape
- **Insight:** "I didn't realize I felt that way"
- **Reduced Resistance:** Easier transition to journaling (40% less "I don't know what to write")
- **Play State:** Lowers perfectionism, increases creative flow

[Continue for all shapes]
```

**VR Round 2: Free Flow**
```
Canvas Mode: Merged Canvas
[The two canvases merge into one large shared space]

Sophia: "Now let your hands move freely. No rules."

[Background music shifts to flowing piano]
[Spatial audio creates subtle binaural effect]

[5 minutes of free bilateral drawing in 3D space]
```

**VR Round 3: Balance Image**
```
Canvas Mode: Unified Canvas
[Single large canvas directly in front]

Sophia: "Create an image of balance. Both hands collaborate."

[Optional: Sophia offers prompts]
- "Imagine two energies finding harmony"
- "What does balance look like in form?"

[User creates balance image in VR]
```

---

**VR-Specific Reflection:**
```
Sophia: "Step back and look at what you created."

[User can walk around the 3D drawing]

Sophia asks:
1. "How does it feel to see your creation in three dimensions?"
2. "What did you notice about your hands working together in space?"
3. "Where did you feel most connected—in symmetry or in freedom?"
4. "What does this drawing want you to remember?"

[User can save the 3D drawing as a hologram or flatten it to 2D]
```

**VR Body Scan Close:**
```
Sophia: "Let's return to your body."

[VR environment slowly dims]
[Sophia's voice becomes more present, closer]

Sophia guides grounded body scan:
"Feel your feet in your physical space, even as you stand here with me.
Notice the weight of the headset on your head—you are here, now, safe.
Take three breaths with me..."

[Breathing animation: soft light pulses with breath rhythm]

Sophia: "When you're ready, you may remove your headset."

[VR session ends gracefully]
```

### EXPECTED OUTCOMES

**Neurological:**
- **Interhemispheric Coherence:** Increased communication between left/right brain
- **Stress Reduction:** 20-30% reduction in cortisol (bilateral stimulation effect)
- **Heart Rate Variability:** +10-15% improvement

**Psychological:**
- **Grounding:** 85% report feeling "more present"
- **Regulation:** Effective for anxiety, rumination, overwhelm
- **Insight:** "I didn't realize my non-dominant hand had so much to say"

**Clinical:**
- Similar benefits to EMDR bilateral stimulation (regulated, safe)
- Somatic processing without verbal requirement
- Integrative: whole-brain engagement

---

### SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Code Yellow Modifications:**
- Start with shorter rounds (3 min each)
- Add extra grounding before starting
- Offer option to use only dominant hand if bilateral is too activating

**Not Recommended For:**
- Acute dissociation (use 5-4-3-2-1 instead)
- Motor impairments (adapt to one-hand, voice-guided visualization)
- Vertigo/dizziness (skip VR mode, use seated paper version)
