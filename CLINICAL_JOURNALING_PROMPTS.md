**Opening Prompt:**
```
Write about: {{topic}}

Let your thoughts flow without stopping.
Don't worry about spelling, grammar, or making sense.
If you get stuck, write "I'm stuck" and keep moving.
Keep your pen moving (or fingers typing) continuously.

[TIMER STARTS: 7:00]
```

**Guideposts (appear at intervals):**

**At 2:00 (Physical):**
```
Keep going. You're doing this correctly.
```

**At 2:00 (Emotional):**
```
You might notice thoughts beginning to deepen. Stay with whatever emerges.
```

**At 4:00 (Physical):**

---

#### 3. TRANSITION (30 seconds)

**Physical:**
```
Your 7 minutes are complete.
Stop writing.
Place your pen down.
Take one deep breath.
```

**Emotional:**
```
You can let your writing come to a natural close.
When you're ready, set down your pen.
Take a moment to notice how you feel.
```

---

#### 4. REFLECTION PROMPTS (3 questions)

```
Now, take a few minutes to reflect:

1. What surprised you about what you wrote?

2. What emotion or feeling is most present right now?

3. If this writing had one message for you, what would it be?

[Allow 3-5 minutes for reflection]
```

---

#### 5. CLOSE (Breath + Reassurance)

**Physical:**
```
Take three deep breaths with me.

[Breath 1] In through your nose... hold... out through your mouth.
[Breath 2] In... hold... out.
[Breath 3] In... hold... out.

You completed this exercise.
Your writing is saved.
You can return to it anytime.
```

**Emotional:**
```
Let's take a moment to ground together.

[Breath 1] As you breathe in, notice your body here, now. As you breathe out, let any tension soften.
[Breath 2] Breathing in, honor what you shared. Breathing out, thank yourself for showing up.
[Breath 3] One more breath, knowing you can carry this awareness with you.

You did beautiful work today.
What you wrote matters, and it's held safely here.
```

---

### Safety Considerations

**Code Yellow Modifications:**
- Reduce to 5 minutes
- Add extra grounding: "Notice your feet on the floor. Notice your breath."
- Gentler reflection: "What felt supportive about this writing?"

**Code Red Prevention:**
- If user writes explicit crisis content, Safety Guardian triggers EmergencySafety state
- Session pauses, crisis resources displayed
- Entry saved (hashed), HITL escalated

---

### Expected Outcomes
- Word count: 300-700 words (7 min average)
- Themes extracted: 2-4
- Sentiment shift: +0.1 to +0.4 (cathartic release)
- User feedback: "I didn't know I felt that way"

---

## B2. INVENTORY (Structured Problem/Goal Inquiry)

### Purpose
Systematic assessment of a life area or decision using a structured 6-column framework. Clarifies facts vs feelings vs beliefs.

### Clinical Indication
- Decision-making paralysis
- Overwhelmed by complexity
- Need for clarity and organization
- Cognitive distortions (beliefs vs facts)

### Template Variables
```
{{issue_or_question}} = "Career change" | "Relationship conflict" | etc.

### FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (5 Clarifying Questions)

**Physical Version (Direct):**
```
Answer these questions based on your inventory:

1. Which belief in your "Beliefs" column is strongest? Is it serving you?

2. Look at your "Needs" column. Which need is most urgent right now?

3. Which option in your "Options" column feels most aligned with your needs?

4. What barrier is preventing you from taking your "First Step" today?

5. If someone you loved was in this exact situation, what would you advise them?
```

**Emotional Version (Inferential):**
```
As you sit with your inventory, consider:

1. Notice the beliefs you wrote down. If you could set one aside for a moment, which would free you most?

2. Your needs are speaking to you. Which one feels like it's been waiting longest to be heard?

3. Imagine yourself one year from now, having honored your needs. Which option got you there?

4. What might be the hidden gift in the barrier you're facing?

5. If your wisest self could whisper one truth to you right now, what would it be?
```

---

### GROUNDING CLOSE (2 minutes)

**Physical:**
```
Take a moment to review what you discovered.

Place your hand on your heart.
Take 3 deep breaths.

[Breath 1] In... out.
[Breath 2] In... out.
[Breath 3] In... out.

You now have clarity on your next step.
You can return to this inventory anytime.
```

**Emotional:**
```
Let's bring this exercise to a gentle close.

Place your hand on your heart, if that feels comfortable.
As you breathe, thank yourself for this honest exploration.

[Breath 1] Breathing in, I honor my needs. Breathing out, I trust my wisdom.
[Breath 2] Breathing in, I release shoulds. Breathing out, I choose what's true.
[Breath 3] Breathing in, I am enough. Breathing out, I move forward.

The clarity you gained today stays with you.
```

{{duration_minutes}} = 15 (default) or 10-20
```

---

### SAFETY PROTOCOL

**Intensity Assessment (Pre-Exercise):**
```
On a scale of 1-5, how intense are your feelings about {{recipient_role}}?

```

---

### SESSION STRUCTURE

#### 1. SET INTENTION (2 minutes)

**Physical:**
```
You will write an unsent letter to {{recipient_role}}.

This letter is for you, not them.
You will NOT send this letter.
Say what you need to say.
Begin when you're ready.
```

**Emotional:**
```
Imagine creating a safe space where you can express what's been unspoken.

This letter is a gift to yourself—a way to honor your truth.
You're free to say anything here, knowing it stays with you.
Whatever wants to come through, let it.
You might begin when you feel ready.
```

---

#### 2. WRITE THE LETTER (Scaffolded Prompts - 15 minutes)

**Opening Prompt:**
```
Dear {{recipient_role}},

[Start with: "I need to tell you..." or "I want you to know..."]

What I wish you understood is...
What I've been carrying is...
What I need to say is...
What I'm releasing is...

```

---

#### 3. OPTIONAL BOUNDARY STATEMENT (2 minutes)

```
Now write one sentence that states a boundary or truth:

"From now on, I will..."
"I am no longer willing to..."
"I choose to..."

[Example: "From now on, I will speak my truth even when my voice shakes."]
```

**Emotional:**
```
If it feels right, you might honor this moment by writing a gentle promise to yourself:

"I am worthy of..."
"I give myself permission to..."
"I release the need to..."

[Example: "I give myself permission to take up space without apologizing."]
```

---

#### 4. INTEGRATION (3 minutes)

```
Reflection: What did I learn from writing this letter?

[Possible responses to notice:]
- I learned I'm angrier than I thought
- I learned I'm ready to forgive
- I learned I have needs that weren't met
- I learned I deserve better

[Write 2-3 sentences about your insight]
```

---

#### 5. CLOSE (Self-Compassion + Grounding)

**Physical (Intensity 1-3):**
```
Take 3 deep breaths.

[Breath 1] In... out.
[Breath 2] In... out.
[Breath 3] In... out.

You expressed what needed to be said.
Your letter is saved safely here.
You can let this go now.
```

**Physical (Intensity 4-5 - Extended Grounding):**
```
Let's ground together. This was big work.

Place both feet flat on the floor.
Notice 5 things you can see.
Notice 4 things you can touch.
Notice 3 things you can hear.
Notice 2 things you can smell.
Notice 1 thing you can taste.

Take 5 deep breaths.
[Guide each breath: In... 2, 3, 4... Out... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

You are safe.
You did courageous work.
Your body knows how to regulate.
```

**Emotional (Intensity 1-3):**
```
Let's honor this moment together.

Place your hand on your heart.
As you breathe, feel your own presence supporting you.

[Breath 1] Breathing in, I honor my truth. Breathing out, I release what I carried.
[Breath 2] Breathing in, I am whole. Breathing out, I am free.
[Breath 3] Breathing in, I am compassion. Breathing out, I am peace.

What you shared today took courage.
You showed up for yourself.
That is profound.
```

**Emotional (Intensity 4-5 - Extended Grounding):**
```
This was deep work. Let's take our time coming back.

Imagine yourself in a safe, comfortable place.
Notice the details—colors, textures, sounds.
Feel your body held and supported.

[Extended 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding with softer language]
Notice 5 things that feel safe...
Notice 4 things that feel grounding...
Notice 3 sounds that remind you where you are...
Notice 2 scents or tastes that anchor you...
Notice 1 breath that belongs only to you...

Take as many breaths as you need.
You are here, now, and you are safe.
Your nervous system is recalibrating.
There is no rush.

You are incredibly brave.
What you processed today will integrate in its own time.
Trust yourself.
```

---

#### RULES FOR CONTINUING TO 100

**Physical:**
```
When you get stuck (around item 30-40), use these strategies:

1. Keep writing "I don't know what else" until something emerges.
2. Look around your physical space for inspiration.
3. Think about different life areas: work, home, relationships, hobbies.
4. Go microscopic (e.g., "The smell of basil" instead of "Cooking").
5. No perfection—write ANYTHING that fits the theme.

The goal is 100 items. You can do this.
```

**Emotional:**
```
Around item 30-40, you might notice resistance or "I'm done."
This is the threshold where deeper material lives.

When you feel stuck, you might:
- Soften your criteria and let smaller things count
- Notice what's in your immediate environment
- Ask "What else?" with gentle curiosity
- Trust that your unconscious has more to offer
- Remember: The last 30 items are where the gold is

There's no rush. Keep breathing. Keep listing.
```

---

### MILESTONE ENCOURAGEMENT

```
At 25 items: "Great start! Keep the momentum going."
At 50 items: "Halfway there! Notice how your mind is opening."
At 75 items: "You're in the zone. The final 25 are often the most revealing."
At 100 items: "You did it! Completing 100 takes real dedication."
```

---

### REVIEW METHOD (After Reaching 100)

**Step 1: Highlight Top 10**
```
Read through your entire list.
Star (*) or highlight the 10 items that feel most significant.
Don't overthink—go with gut feeling.
```

**Step 2: Cluster into 3 Categories**
```
Look at your top 10.
Notice themes or patterns.
Cluster them into 3 categories.

Example (Gratitude theme):
Category 1: Connection (friends, family, community)
Category 2: Simple Pleasures (coffee, sunlight, music)
Category 3: Personal Growth (learning, challenges, health)
```

**Step 3: Pick 1 Action**
```
Based on your 3 categories, identify ONE small action you can take this week to honor what matters most.

Example:
"I notice 'Connection' is important. This week, I will call one friend I've been meaning to reach out to."
```

Take 3 deep breaths.
Notice which hand you normally write with—this is your dominant hand.
Your other hand is your non-dominant hand.
```

**Emotional:**
```
Find a comfortable seat and settle in.
Place your hands gently on your lap.
As you breathe, notice the difference between your two hands.
One is practiced, efficient—your dominant hand.
The other is unpolished, curious—your non-dominant hand.
Today, we'll give that quieter hand a voice.
```

---

#### 2. DOMINANT-HAND QUESTION (Analyst)

**Instructions:**
```
Using your DOMINANT hand (the one you normally write with), write a question to your {{inner_part}}.

Examples:
- (Inner Child) "What do you need me to know?"
- (Inner Wisdom) "What am I not seeing?"
- (Creative Self) "What wants to be created?"

Write your question now.

[User writes question with dominant hand]
```

---

#### 3. NON-DOMINANT-HAND ANSWER (Intuitive)

**Instructions:**
```
Now switch to your NON-DOMINANT hand.

This will feel awkward—that's the point.
Let your {{inner_part}} answer through this hand.
Don't worry about neat handwriting.
Let it be messy, playful, or childlike.

Write the answer that comes.

[User writes answer with non-dominant hand]
```

**What to Expect:**
- Handwriting will be childlike/shaky
- Answers may be simpler, more direct
- Emotional content may surface more easily
- Sentences may be shorter

---

#### 4. DIALOGUE (5 Turns)

**Instructions:**
```
Continue the conversation for 5 exchanges.
Dominant hand asks, non-dominant hand answers.

Dominant hand: "What do you need?"
Non-dominant hand: [Answer]

Dominant hand: "What are you afraid of?"
Non-dominant hand: [Answer]

Dominant hand: "What do you want me to do differently?"
Non-dominant hand: [Answer]

Dominant hand: "How can I support you?"
Non-dominant hand: [Answer]

Dominant hand: "What gift do you have for me?"
Non-dominant hand: [Answer]
```

---

#### 5. INTEGRATION (Dominant-Hand Summary)

**Physical:**
```
Switch back to your DOMINANT hand.

Summarize what you learned from this dialogue in 3-4 sentences.

[User writes summary]
```

**Emotional:**
```
Return to your DOMINANT hand.

As you reflect on this conversation, what stands out?
What did your {{inner_part}} share that surprised you?
What does this part of you most want you to remember?

[User writes integration summary]
```

---

#### 6. ONE CARING ACTION

**Physical:**
```
Based on this dialogue, identify ONE concrete action you can take this week to honor what your {{inner_part}} shared.

Action: _________________________________

Example: "Take a 10-minute play break daily" (Inner Child)
Example: "Trust my gut on the job decision" (Inner Wisdom)
```

**Emotional:**
```
Your {{inner_part}} spoke. Now it's time to listen with action.

What's one tender way you can honor what was shared?
It doesn't have to be big—small acts of care matter most.

This week, I will: _________________________________

[User writes commitment]
```

---

### ACCESSIBILITY ALTERNATIVES

**For Users with Motor Limitations:**

**Option 1: Typing with Non-Dominant Hand**
```
Use your computer keyboard.
Type with only your non-dominant hand (one-handed typing).
The effect is similar—it's slower, more deliberate, less automatic.
```

**Option 2: Voice Recording**
```
Speak your dominant-hand questions aloud.
When it's time for the non-dominant hand response, close your eyes.
Speak in a different voice—softer, slower, or child-like.
Record the dialogue.
```

**Option 3: Visualization Only**
```
Close your eyes.
Visualize the conversation happening internally.
Imagine writing with each hand, but don't physically write.
Notice what each part wants to say.
When complete, write a summary with your dominant hand.
```

---

### Expected Outcomes
- Dialogue exchanges: 5-8
- Common themes: "I need to play", "Trust yourself", "Stop rushing"
- Emotional tone: Vulnerable, direct, honest
- User feedback: "It felt like talking to a younger version of me"

## B11. FORGIVENESS (Without Spiritual Bypassing)

### Purpose

### Clinical Indication
- Resentment/anger
- Need for closure
- Processing betrayal/harm
- Moving forward

### Template Variables
```
{{duration_minutes}} = 20-30
{{person_or_self}} = other | self
```

---

### CRITICAL CLARIFICATIONS (Opening)

**Physical:**
```
IMPORTANT: Read this before you begin.

Forgiveness does NOT mean:
- Excusing what happened
- Pretending it didn't hurt
- Reconciling with the person
- Letting them back into your life
- Saying it was okay

Forgiveness CAN mean:
- Releasing the hold this has on YOU
- Choosing peace for yourself
- Setting boundaries and moving forward
- Acknowledging pain without being controlled by it

This is YOUR choice. No pressure.
```

**Emotional:**
```
Before we begin, let's clarify what forgiveness is and isn't.

Forgiveness isn't spiritual bypassing.
It isn't saying "it's fine" when it wasn't.
It isn't letting someone off the hook.
It isn't reconciliation or allowing harm to continue.

Forgiveness is FOR YOU.
It's releasing the grip this pain has on your peace.
It's honoring the hurt while choosing not to carry it forever.
It's boundary-setting, self-honoring, and freedom.

You get to define what forgiveness means for you.
Let's explore together.
```

---

### SECTION 1: IMPACT STATEMENT (7 minutes)

**Prompt:**
```
What happened? What was the impact on you?

Write the truth about what occurred and how it affected you.
Be specific. Be honest. This is not for them—it's for you.

What Happened:
__________________________________________________
__________________________________________________

How It Affected Me:
__________________________________________________
__________________________________________________
```

---

### SECTION 2: BOUNDARY STATEMENT (7 minutes)

**Prompt:**
```
What boundary do you need to set or maintain related to this person or situation?

Examples:
- "I will not allow this person back into my life"
- "I will limit contact to holidays only"
- "I will speak up when this behavior happens again"
- "I will not accept responsibility for their choices"

My Boundary:
__________________________________________________
__________________________________________________
```

---

### SECTION 3: OPTIONAL RELEASE RITUAL (Words Only) (5 minutes)

**Prompt:**
```
This step is OPTIONAL. If it feels right, complete it. If not, skip it.

Write a release statement that honors your pain while choosing peace.

Template:
"I release [person/situation] from the debt I believed they owed me.
I acknowledge the pain this caused.
I honor the impact it had on me.
And I choose to no longer let it define my days.
I am free to move forward."

OR write your own version.

My Release Statement (Optional):
__________________________________________________
__________________________________________________
__________________________________________________
```

---

### SECTION 4: NEXT-STEP PLAN (5 minutes)

**Prompt:**
```
What's your next step?

This could be:
- A boundary conversation
- Limiting contact
- Seeking therapy
- Writing a letter (sent or unsent)
- Practicing self-compassion
- Moving forward without closure from them

My Next Step:
__________________________________________________
__________________________________________________
```

---

### CLOSING (Neutral, User-Led)

**Physical:**
```
You've done powerful work.

Forgiveness is a process, not a one-time event.
You may need to return to this practice multiple times.
You get to decide what forgiveness means for you.

Take 3 deep breaths.
You are free to move forward.
```

**Emotional:**
```
This was brave and tender work.

Forgiveness isn't linear—it's a spiral.
You might revisit this many times, and that's okay.
What matters is that you're honoring your truth and your boundaries.

Place your hand on your heart.
Breathe in: I honor what hurt me.
Breathe out: I choose peace for myself.
Breathe in: I set boundaries with love.
Breathe out: I am free.

You decide what healing looks like.
You are already whole.
```

---

### Expected Outcomes
- Impact acknowledged (not minimized)
- Boundary clarified (actionable)
- Release optional (user chooses)
- Next step identified
- User feedback: "I didn't realize forgiveness could look like this"
