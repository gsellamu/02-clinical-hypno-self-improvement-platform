      "raw_text": "Emotional and Physical Sexuality\nThe Emotional and Physical Sexuality model was authored by Dr. John Kappas in the early 1970s and was a unique\nand revolutionary model in that it completely dismissed gender as a basis for understanding and predicting behavior\nin relationships. Many, if not most, relationship models then and today rely on gender as the main understanding of\nbehavior in relationships. Dr. Kappas relied on years of work with clients, as well as discussion, debate, and\ncomparisons with his colleagues at HMI, to further develop and refine the model.\nThe name “Emotional and Physical” can confuse the newly initiated if they take them literally. The “Emotional” does\nnot experience more “emotions” as the name might imply. Other suggested names for the Emotional, like the\n“Intellectual,” were rejected because it implies that Emotionals are inherently smarter or have greater intellect, which\nis not true and not suggested in Dr. Kappas’ model. Due to the long history of the terms at HMI, the Emotional and\nPhysical terms have been maintained. Any confusion is generally easily overcome by both students and clients alike.\nThe alternative terms “Emo” and “Phys” and just “E&P” are also used synonymously in the model and help\nnewcomers to the model to get past the literal meanings of Emotional and Physical.\nDuring this lecture, it will appear as if we are talking about two completely separate categories of behavior; however,\nit is best to view E&P as opposite sides of a spectrum. Each individual will favor one side of the spectrum over the\nother; rarely is a person 100% of either category but rather a percentage of one over the other.\nEmotional Sexuality – X – Physical Sexuality\n100% - - - - - - - - - - - X - - - - - - - - - - - 100%\nFor simplicity, in this lesson, we will describe the Emotional and Physical Sexual as if each were 100% on\ntheir side of the spectrum.\nGeneralizations in models are essential, despite the presence of exceptions. Focusing too much on exceptions can\nhinder our understanding of the model.\nWhen it comes to relationship behavior, there is no right or wrong – only differences. What makes this model unique\nis its focus on two distinct personality types that operate below the level of awareness. These are referred to as\nsubconscious behaviors or subconscious personalities.\nDuring the development of this model, a common pattern emerged: individuals are subconsciously drawn to others\nwho are their opposites at a subconscious level. This is not immediately apparent because, on a conscious level,\nthese individuals may appear very similar. They might share the same race, religion, political affiliation,\nsocioeconomic status, hobbies, and other visible traits. They could seem like clones on the surface, yet on a\nsubconscious level, they are complete opposites. These differences often become evident as the relationship\nprogresses, leading to potential conflict.\nTo further explore these dynamics, researchers developed a set of questionnaires to measure relationships. They\nclassified behaviors into two extremes to create a test. Individuals could score anywhere from 0% to 100% on either\nthe Emotional or Physical spectrum. When the results were plotted on a graph, they revealed a bimodal distribution –\ntwo overlapping bell curves with two distinct peaks. On average, most people scored around 65% on the Physical\nside and 65% on the Emotional side. These individuals were more likely to attract each other. Interestingly, the more\nextreme an individual's score, the more extreme their partner's score tended to be on the opposite side. For example,\nsomeone scoring 80% Physical would likely attract someone scoring 80% Emotional, and so forth.\nThis bimodal distribution explains the origins of conflict. When entering a new relationship, people often assume that\ntheir partner thinks like they do, shares the same values, and prioritizes similar things. However, the subconscious\ndifferences can lead to misunderstandings and tension over time.",

      "raw_text": "The initial version of the Emotional and Physical (E&P) model was nicknamed the \"silent conspiracy.\" This was based\non the observation that most therapists tended to score higher on the Physical personality scale. As a result, they\noften viewed their own perspectives and approaches to relationships as the norm. If a client's perspective differed,\ntherapists might unknowingly attempt to \"correct\" them, failing to recognize that there are two equally valid sets of\nnorms. The authors of the model argued that this bias inadvertently marginalized the other 50% of the population –\nthose with Emotional personalities. This bias was not limited to therapists but was also reflected in societal norms,\nfurther reinforcing the silent conspiracy against Emotional personalities.\nDr. Kappas coined the term “Buy the Symptoms” to describe an essential concept to improve relationships. It means\nthat when you're in a relationship with your partner, you must accept and embrace the very traits or behaviors that\nmight bother you – the differences you judge or struggle with. These \"symptoms\" are often the precise reasons you\nwere attracted to them in the first place.\nMany people believe they want to be with someone just like them, thinking it would make life easier. However,\nchances are, you've tried that before, and it didn’t work. Such relationships often become either too platonic or\nriddled with conflict, as both partners compete for the same space. In reality, complementarity – being with someone\nwho balances you out – creates a stronger attraction, a more solid union, and a more functional relationship than\nbeing with someone exactly like you on this scale.\n“Buying the symptoms” means acknowledging that you are naturally drawn to individuals who are your opposites on\na subconscious level. It’s about understanding what those differences mean, how they manifest in your relationship,\nand how to make them work in your favor.\nHow Sexuality is Developed\nThe three (3) primary goals of the model are, in order:\n1. Understanding: To understand the behavior of oneself and partner in relationships so that it makes sense why\neach partner behaves the way they do. This understanding reduces stress and increases tolerance and\nacceptance of the differences between the two partners.\n2. Predicting: The understanding of E&P behavior leads to the ability to predict E&P behavior. If one can predict\nthemselves or their partner’s response or behavior, it again provides greater tolerance, acceptance, and\ncompassion for themselves or their partner.\n3. Shaping: If one can predict the response of themselves or their partner to a communication or response to a\nsituation and stimulus in the relationship, it gives them the option to reconsider that stimulus or re-word their\ncommunication to receive the desired response. This option to choose allows the shaping of behavior for\nthemselves or their partners.\nThe Sexuality Test should be viewed as an introduction to the model, as self-administered tests come with an\ninherent limitation: they are not entirely objective. When judging your own behavior, social desirability factors often\ninfluence your responses. You tend to see yourself as you want to be seen, rather than as you are perceived by\nothers objectively.",

We will defer those concepts to E&P Part 2 to avoid confusion early on.\nGoals for this Lecture\nWatch the lecture carefully to gain a solid grasp on how we determine one’s E&P Score.\nLearn the difference between using the E&P questionnaire vs. the more detailed approach of discovering the Four\nCore Traits.\nHow are the Core Traits different from Surface Traits?\nBe prepared to discuss these Four Core Traits in detail:\n1. Family of Origin\n2. Response to Rejection\n3. Relationship to Physical Body\n4.

This is merely a surface trait.\nEmotional vs Logical\nWhile Physicals are often more heart-driven and Emotionals more head-driven, this distinction is not a core trait.\nClothing Style or Appearance\nCharacteristics like long painted fingernails, the type of car one drives, flashy or conservative dress styles, or\nwearing glasses are all surface traits and do not define one’s core personality.\nDrawing Attention to Oneself\nThis is also a surface trait, not a defining feature of either type.\nLife Priorities or Career Choices\nThese are surface traits and not directly indicative of one’s core personality.",

      "raw_text": "The Four Core Traits\n1. Relationship to the Physical Body\nPhysicals: Physicals have a strong connection with their physical body and process emotions through their\nbodies and minds.\nThey experience emotions immediately and physically.\nThey don’t need to think about how they feel; it’s instinctive.\nThey interact with the world through their physical body, often expressing themselves through touch\nand closeness.\nEmotionals: Emotionals have a more disconnected relationship with their physical body and primarily\nprocess emotions in their mind.\nThey may feel emotions without a physical response.\nTheir emotional reactions tend to be delayed and rationalized.\nThey interact with the world less through their body and are less certain about their feelings.\n2. Response to Rejection\nPhysicals: Physicals tend to come forward and address feelings of rejection directly.\nThey are more likely to reach out, talk about the issue, and seek to repair the relationship.\nEmotionals: Emotionals often withdraw or shut down when they feel rejected.\nThey wall off their emotions and detach themselves.\nExample: If threatened with being fired at work, they might unconsciously quit first to avoid rejection.\n3. Patterns in Romantic Relationships\nObserving a person’s usual attractions and behavior in relationships can provide insights.\nEmotionals are often attracted to Physicals, and Physicals are often attracted to Emotionals.\nPast behavior is one of the best predictors of future behavior.\n4. Family of Origin\nA person’s behavior often reflects the dominant Secondary Caretaker observed during childhood, typically\nthe father in traditional family structures.\nUnderstanding why the priorities of Emotionals and Physicals differ is key to understanding how these\ndifferences influence relationships and the Four Core Traits.\nImportant Note: Each of the core traits alone is only 25% accurate in determining someone’s sexuality type.\nIdentifying two of the core traits increases the likelihood to 50%. To accurately determine someone’s sexuality type,\nat least three out of the four core traits are required.",

      "raw_text": "Differences Between the E&P Model and Traditional Marriage or Relationship\nModels\nNon-Gender-Based Model\nThis model rejects gender stereotypes and abandons the notion that men and women behave in fixed,\nspecific ways. It does not require knowledge of gender to predict behavior.\nRejects Sexual Orientation\nThe model applies to individuals regardless of their sexual orientation. It works equally well for\nheterosexual, homosexual, or other types of couples.\nChallenges Parental-Based Marriage Myths\nRejects the idea that girls marry someone like their fathers and boys marry someone like their mothers.\nInstead, this model suggests that everyone grows up to marry someone who mirrors their mother’s\nbehavior. Through observation, people tend to model the behavior of their secondary caretaker, often\nresulting in marrying someone with opposite behaviors.\nCan Sexuality Change from Emo to Phys or Vice Versa?\nWhile Sexuality cannot be changed, it is flexible. It is triggered in different ways at different times. Our behavior can\nebb and flow with different relationships. This means there is a critical stage during childhood where this personality\ntype solidifies (from 9-15). By around the age of 12 or 13, neuroplasticity in this area closes, and your sexuality type\nbecomes cemented for life. It is a lifelong personality that does not change.\nUnderstanding Rejection in Relationships\nRejection plays a significant role in the dynamics between Emotionals and Physicals, but it often manifests differently\nfor each type.\nPhysicals: Physicals may claim they rejected their partner, but upon closer examination, they are often\nresponding to subtle, prolonged rejection from the Emotional. They eventually reach a breaking point, feeling\nthey can’t take it anymore, and end the relationship. However, this act of \"ending\" is frequently a reaction to the\nrejection they’ve experienced over time.\nEmotionals: Emotionals tend to avoid confrontation, especially with Physicals. They are not naturally good\nconfronters and often engage in subtle, passive-aggressive forms of rejection. Over time, this subtle rejection\nbuilds up until it becomes overwhelming for the Physical, leading to an eventual breakup.\nEmotionals often want the Physical to end the relationship so they can exit without feeling guilt. Since\nEmotionals intellectualize their emotions, avoiding guilt becomes a significant motivation. By rationalizing\nthe situation and denying their role in the rejection, they can distance themselves from responsibility.\nThis pattern highlights a common negative trait of Emotionals: the tendency to subtly reject their partner and avoid\naccountability for the relationship's decline.",

      "raw_text": "Common Patterns\nRebound Relationships in the E&P Model\nWhen a Physical is subtly rejected in a relationship by an Emotional, leading to a breakup, there is often a tendency\nfor the rebound relationship to involve another Physical – usually someone higher on the Physical scale. However,\nwhen two dominant individuals come together, the dynamic can shift, often resulting in platonic friendships or\nconflicts due to competing dominance.\nThe Rebound Cycle\nEmotional Fallout: Following the breakup, the Physical experiences emotional pain and feelings of rejection.\nOver time, loneliness and a desire for recovery lead them to seek a new partner.\nIn their previous relationship, the Emotional partner likely stopped complimenting them and providing\nemotional support, leaving the Physical feeling unattractive and undesired.\nIn the rebound relationship, the new Physical partner often fulfills these unmet needs, offering compliments,\nphysical attraction, and validation.\nInitial Fulfillment:\nIn these rebound relationships, the new partner makes the Physical feel beautiful, desired, and valued –\neverything they were missing before.\nFor a time, this feels like exactly what the Physical needed to heal their self-esteem.\nEmerging Conflicts:\nOver time, the Physical begins to miss key aspects of their identity in the relationship, such as being the\ndominant and spontaneous leader.\nIn this new relationship, they often play the role of the Emotional partner, which feels safer but not entirely\nauthentic to their nature.\nDominance Clashes:\nPhysicals tend to dominate in relationships, and when two Physicals come together, they may clash for\ndominance.\nThese relationships often end in one of two ways: the partnership becomes platonic or combative\nRecovery and Return to Emotional Partners\nSometimes, a Physical may go through one or two rebound relationships with other Physicals before fully recovering.\nOnce they rebuild their self-esteem and confidence, they may feel ready to be vulnerable again. This often leads\nthem back to an Emotional partner, seeking a longer-term, more meaningful connection.\nRebound relationships with other Physicals tend to be shorter in duration, serving as a transitional phase. A longer\nrelationship with an Emotional partner afterward typically signifies the Physical’s readiness to engage in deeper\nemotional vulnerability again. These patterns highlight not only a high-Physical personality but also the cyclical nature\nof healing and connection in relationships.",

      "raw_text": "Reasons for Infidelity\nPhysicals: Cheat to relieve the pain of rejection and seek acceptance.\nFor Physicals, infidelity is often a response to the deep emotional and physical pain caused by rejection\nfrom their partner. They feel deprived of emotional connection, physical touch, and intimacy, which they\nexperience as a tangible pain. Cheating offers temporary relief from this pain and provides a sense of\nacceptance and validation.\nPhysicals typically cheat with other rejected Physicals who are experiencing similar pain and needs.\nInitially, this dynamic feels good as they fulfill each other’s immediate emotional voids, but deeper issues\noften arise once these immediate needs are met.\nSubconsciously, they want to be caught by their partner. Their reasoning is twofold:\nThey hope their partner will experience the pain they felt from rejection\nThey believe that if their partner understands the hurt, they will change their behavior and reengage in\nthe relationship.\nHowever, this rarely has the desired effect. In most cases, being caught relieves the Emotional of guilt,\nenabling them to walk away from the relationship without regret. Often, guilt was the main factor keeping\nthe Emotional in the relationship in the first place.\nEmotionals: Cheat due to emotional shutdown or a lack of attraction.\nEmotionals cheat for entirely different reasons. Their infidelity stems from gradually shutting down\nemotionally, losing attraction to their partner, and feeling that something is missing in the relationship. They\nseek to replace what they perceive as lacking.\nWhen Emotionals cheat, it is not necessarily due to unhappiness with their family or partnership. For them,\nit’s often purely a sexual matter, with a clear separation between their emotions and physical actions.\nEmotionals are more likely to have ongoing affairs that remain undiscovered.\nThey avoid confronting the Physical because they find Physicals difficult to address.\nFinancial security concerns may also prevent them from jeopardizing the relationship.\nPower Dynamics in Relationships\nEveryone seeks a sense of power in a relationship, but Physicals and Emotionals approach it differently:\nPhysicals often dominate the relationship by:\nGuiding decisions and determining daily activities.\nOccupying space and taking control of interactions.\nMaking many small decisions that add up to an overarching dominance. Over time, this dominance can\nlead to resentment from the Emotional partner.\nSince Emotionals cannot out-dominate a dominant partner, they balance the power dynamic through subtle acts\nof rejection. This rejection allows them to reclaim some control in the relationship, albeit in an indirect way.",

      "raw_text": "Counseling for Less Conflict\nUnderstanding Behavioral Dominance: If someone is 65% Physical, they are dominant on the Physical side,\nwith 35% Emotional traits. People are rarely black-and-white in their behaviors.\nIndividuals closer to the center of the scale (e.g., 55% Physical and 45% Emotional) are more likely to\nexperience less conflict in relationships. They have overlapping behaviors that make compatibility easier.\nHighly dominant individuals on either side of the scale (e.g., 70% and above) are more prone to conflicts,\nas their behaviors are more extreme and contrasting.\nDe-Exaggerating Behaviors:\nA strategy to reduce conflict involves “de-exaggerating” behavior by encouraging individuals to dial back\ntheir dominant traits slightly (e.g., reducing by 10%). This minor adjustment can create a 20% swing in the\ndynamics, fostering better compatibility and comfort in the relationship.\nBy understanding and accepting the opposite behaviors of their partner, individuals can relieve much of the\nstress caused by misunderstandings.\nIf an Emotional wants to reduce their Physical partner’s neediness or jealousy, they can make their partner\nfeel more secure by showing their partner they are desired, making them feel wanted. Providing these\nreassurances fulfills the Physical’s needs (or “Twinkies”) and helps lower their dominant Physical traits. As\nthese needs are met, their intensity naturally decreases over time.\nPhysicals should allow the Emotional space and wait for them to come forward. Giving Emotionals this\nspace respects their needs and enables the relationship to balance naturally.\nSystemic Change:\nUnderstanding that partners are opposites allows for a greater sense of acceptance and reduces\nfrustration. When individuals recognize that their partner’s behavior stems from their personality type, it\nlowers stress and minimizes perceived issues.\nChanging one partner’s behavior naturally impacts the other. In systemic relationships, lowering one\nperson’s exaggerated behaviors tends to reduce the other’s as well, creating balance and harmony.\nAccommodating Differences:\nRecognizing and accommodating the differences between Physicals and Emotionals leads to more\nfunctional relationships. Acceptance of these behavioral contrasts is key to building mutual understanding\nand reducing conflict.",

A common theme among\nthese groups is the presence of a physical male partner at home, whom they may avoid through these\ngatherings.

Then you will be able to apply proven concepts to maintain the\nbalance necessary to fulfill the needs of two differing styles of personality.”\nGive them a Twinkie\nProvide your partner with something from their priority list rather than your own. For example, if the Emotional partner\nprioritizes career success, the Physical can offer time and space to focus on their work or hobbies. Conversely, a\nPhysical may need physical affection and validation, which the Emotional can express through small gestures like a\nnote or a compliment, making them feel desired.\nCycle Days\nEmotionals experience heightened sexual desire approximately every third day. The concept of cycle days is most\napplicable during the plateau stages of relationships when everything is “normal” (after the Honeymoon Stage).\n1. Day 1: Disconnected from their physical body, prioritizing hobbies or career.\n2. Day 2: Middle phase, neutral.\n3. Day 3: Most connected to their physical body, making intimacy and sexual connection a priority.\nNegative experiences of rejection in this dynamic can extend the cycle, potentially leading to longer gaps in intimacy.\nHoneymoon Stage\nEvery relationship begins with a honeymoon stage, marked by fascination and heightened sexual chemistry. In this\nStage, Emotionals behave more like Physicals, pursuing their partner more, drawn to the connection and novelty\ntheir partner provides. Physicals behave less dominantly as the Emotional’s pursuit balances their usual need to\ncome forward. They feel comfortable and confident when they feel wanted and pursued by their Emo partner.",

      "raw_text": "Cycle Days and the Honeymoon Stage\nWhat are “Cycle Days”? How do they relate to the Honeymoon Stage?\nDuring the honeymoon stage, the Emotional is more interested in frequent sexual intercourse. After the honeymoon\nstage, that behavior comes back to “normal”, and their sexual desire peaks every third day.\nIn the Honeymoon Stage, the Emotional tends to behave more Physical. Why?\nThe Emotional partner, intrigued and mentally stimulated by his or her Physical lover, behaves in a manner which\nappears more Physical than Emotional. The Emotional is suddenly interested in frequent intercourse and other\nsexual activities. He or she is delighted to concentrate on pleasing the partner, because of the novelty of watching\nthe responses of a new and different individual, possessed by that fascinating “otherness.”\nIn the Honeymoon Stage, the Physical tends to behave less Physical. Why?\nDuring the honeymoon stage, the Emotional behaves more like a Physical, pursuing their Physical partner more,\nwhich means the Physical won’t need to come forward as much. The Emo behavior will naturally lessen the Physical\ndominance of the Physical partner.\nOther Important Questions and Concepts to Grasp\nWhy is the Emotional attracted to the Physical and vice versa?\nOpposites attract because complementary differences enhance the relationship. This dynamic creates balance,\nallowing each partner to feel whole by compensating for their weaknesses with the other’s strengths.\nWhy isn’t it better for E’s to be with E’s and P’s to be with P’s?\nTwo Emotionals may feel emotionally distant, focusing on separate priorities without a strong bond. Two Physicals\nwill often clash due to their shared need for dominance, which can lead to frequent conflicts. “Too much similarity\ncauses us to drift away, uninterested, unchallenged.”\nWhen and how is it appropriate to incorporate this concept into your hypnotherapy\npractice?\nE&P theory is most useful when a client aims to improve their relationship with a partner, re-trigger the honeymoon\nstage, or attract a compatible partner. It’s not necessary to ask about sexuality type in the first session – it depends\non the client’s presenting issues.\nDefine and discuss Dominance vs Sub-Dominance.\nDominance: Refers to the partner’s primary behavioral traits (e.g., 60% Physical).\nSub-Dominance: Reflects the secondary traits that appear less frequently (e.g., 40% Emotional).\nFor example, when someone is 60% Physical sexual, it means that roughly 60% of the time, they will act out the\ncharacteristics of a Physical sexual; this is their dominant behavior. Approximately 40% of the time, though, they will\nexhibit traits of the Emotional Sexual; this is their sub-dominant behavior.\nDefine and discuss Primary vs Secondary Caretaker.\nPrimary Caretaker: Often the mother or a mother figure.",
