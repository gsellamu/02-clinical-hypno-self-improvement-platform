While we generally expect Physicals to be more\nextroverted, a shy Physical or an Emotional who is extroverted due to their job, career, or specific training can\nexist. This is merely a surface trait.\nEmotional vs Logical\nWhile Physicals are often more heart-driven and Emotionals more head-driven, this distinction is not a core trait.\nClothing Sty"
